    """Wrapper function for gen_focusing_profile. Generate a stack of theoretical transmittance and phase profiles for
    focusing light of particular depths and wavelengths, onto the sensor plane.

    This is sometimes more convenient to call than `gen_focusing_profiles` directly as it does not require explicitly
    unpacking the relevent function inputs in another script. Returns the profile(s) for focusing given the incident
    wavelength, object distance, of off-axis focal shift combinations passed in list form.

    Args:
        `parameters` (prop_param):  Settings object defining field propagation details. wavelength parameter key is not
            used. Only the geometry of the metasurface grid is pulled out.
        `wavelength_m_aslist` (list): N length list of floats defining incident wavelength_m in meters, to be designed
            for by the metasurface profile instantiation.
        `focal_distance_m_aslist` (list): N length list containing in-focus object-to-lens plane distances, in units of
            meters.
        `focus_offset_m_aslist` (list): N length list containing the off-axis focal-point shift at the sensor,
            via {"x": np.float, "y": np.float}.

        ValueError: All inputted lists must have same number of items
        ValueError: lens radius exceeds the minimum radius of the initialzed lens-grid

    Returns:
        `np.float`: Transmittance profiles, of shape (n, ms_samplesM["y"], ms_samplesM["x"]) or (n, 1, ms_samplesM["r"]).
        `np.float`: Phase profiles, of shape (n, ms_samplesM["y"], ms_samplesM["x"]) or (n, 1, ms_samplesM["r"]).
