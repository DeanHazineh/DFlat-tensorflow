o QE Estimates for Pregius were pulled from link:
    https://scientificimaging.com/knowledge-base/quantum-efficiency-and-spectral-responsivity-of-scmos-and-cmos-imagers/
    They are only estimates and not validated calibration data! It is useful for test simulations however

o QE estimtates (with Bayer filter) for the Basler_Ace2 camera was conduced by B Arad et al. in paper
    "NTIRE 2022 Spectral Recovery Challenge and Data Set". Data was obtained from paper github
