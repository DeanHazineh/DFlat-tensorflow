v 1.1.3 -- Bug Fix
    - Issue: Library classes could not resolve paths to the data files in cell_library_generation.
    - Added manifest.in file to ensure data files were packaged and then bootstrapped filepath via the 
    - "bad method 1" in https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6028000/how-to-read-a-static-file-from-inside-a-python-package/58941536#58941536

v 1.1.4 -- Add new library -- double fins

v 1.1.5 -- Bug Fix 
    - Hardcode pathing on the neural models had same problem as metasurface datasets
    - updated pathing with same solution as v 1.1.3 

V 2.0.0 -- Recoded Fourier Optics propagation
    - Fourier optics propagation handles broadband more efficiently
    - A matrix implementation for the angular spectrum method is introduced to solve broadband field propagation with 
    large tensors instead of for loops
    - General package structures and names are reintroduced
    - Fixed bug in Neural optical models where sqrt(transmission) would return NaN for some cells

V 2.1.0 -- Fix the library generation code so it directly calibrates to the reference field and returns transmission and phase
    - Reference field is needed to make the output meaningful. Instead of returning the field and the reference field, 
    we just make it easier by doing that internally since it will always be needed. 

V 2.3.0 -- Implemented general software re-organization and changes for ease of use and more intuitive flow
    - fourier layer prop_params initialization with ms_length key caused errors of calculation accuracy and was confusing. This is replaced with flow based on ms_samples. 
        o pass in number of samples in the corresponding field array which is more logical and leads to more accurate calculations
    - RCWA params had all cell_parameterization details removed completely. RCWA_layer now handles details of cell parameterization selection
    - General reorganization of function locations and clean-up
