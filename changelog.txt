v 1.1.3 -- Bug Fix
    - Issue: Library classes could not resolve paths to the data files in cell_library_generation.
    - Added manifest.in file to ensure data files were packaged and then bootstrapped filepath via the 
    - "bad method 1" in https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6028000/how-to-read-a-static-file-from-inside-a-python-package/58941536#58941536

v 1.1.4 -- Add new library -- double fins

v 1.1.5 -- Bug Fix 
    - Hardcode pathing on the neural models had same problem as metasurface datasets
    - updated pathing with same solution as v 1.1.3 

V 2.0.0 -- Recoded Fourier Optics propagation
    - Fourier optics propagation handles broadband more efficiently
    - A matrix implementation for the angular spectrum method is introduced to solve broadband field propagation with 
    large tensors instead of for loops
    - General package structures and names are reintroduced
    - Fixed bug in Neural optical models where sqrt(transmission) would return NaN for some cells
