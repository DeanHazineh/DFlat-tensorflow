## A Design Framework for Metasurface-Based Visual Sensors (Python Tensorflow)
`D-Flat` is a forward and inverse design framework for flat optics, specially geared to the design of dielectric metasurfaces for imaging and sensing. This package is reviewed in paper [Link coming]. D-Flat provides users with: 
- A validated, autodifferentiable framework for optical field propagation
- Pre-trained, efficient neural models to describe the optical response of metasurface cells
- A community driven, maintained framework for rendering and end-to-end design

## Usage and Documentation:
